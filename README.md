How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you? - 

From the date I started this assessment, 27/08/2020, it took hours on multiple afternoons and evenings to complete.

What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2? -

When completing assignment 1 I spend a lot of time backtracking and redoing work. Once I took my time and completed each section step by step and incrementally worked through each function finishing sections of code become much quicker and easier. For assignment 2, instead of rushing in I will take time to ensure I'm writing more efficient code on the first time attempt instead of having to do large amounts of backtracking and creating broken/ unusable code.
